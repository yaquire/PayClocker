This is used as a script to track my total Income
    I have decided to use a GUI, it seems better.
**There will likely be some machine learning, so that the program can extract data from a image**

**{NOTE: CHATGPT has been used}**

- I used chatGPT as the tool to make this script, mostly so that i can also learn,, as chatGPT is not always right & can make mistakes as of writing this README
- When i ran into an issue, i used google, to troubleshoot
- I will annotate when a website/chatGPT gave me the line of code :)

### NOTE
    This is the second version cus the previous version was not well labelled
- [ ] There will be more comments, likely almost every line 
- [ ] There will be a GUI, using flask, most likely
- [ ] There will not be constantly hosted, cus it will cost so much but I could try
- [ ] The data can be uploaded as a screenshot to extract the infromation from the timesheet
- [ ] Camel format will be used
- [ ] Most of the code will be made modular
- [ ] Unit tests will be used (for me to learn ow to do them)
